Suppose developers deliver features as quickly as possible without considering clean code principles at the beginning of the project. In that case, the system turns out messy, and touching even one line of code breaks the whole infrastructure. All developers should consider the below clean code principles to avoid gradual slowness.

## Speed
ğŸŸ£ Go fast, if it goes well.

ğŸŸ£ Do not be overconfident about you will clean the code up later to be fast you can right now.

ğŸŸ£ Improve your coding skills by learning new concepts and making practices to be able to write code faster in long term.

ğŸŸ£ Do not forget there is no way to write faster for tomorrow due to it is an ability that can be gained in long term.

## Functions
ğŸŸ£ Do not add above two or three arguments in a function.

ğŸŸ£ Do not pass hardly ever be 20 lines long in a function block.

ğŸŸ£ Stay at one or two indent level in a function block for readability.

ğŸŸ£ Make each function responsible for a single action.

ğŸŸ£ Do not repeat yourself by gathering code snippets that have same purpose under a function.

ğŸ’œ You should leverage objects or data structures when you need to pass more than three things into a function.

## Exceptions
ğŸŸ£ Prefer exceptions instead of returning errors.

ğŸŸ£ Avoid using nested track path blocks into the exception blocks.

## Comments
ğŸŸ£ Try to explain your code itself without comment.

ğŸŸ£ Try everything else then comment as a last resort because every use of a comment represents a failure.

ğŸŸ£ Clean it before commenting when you write the bad code.

ğŸŸ£ Do not forget comments do not make up for bad code.

ğŸŸ£ Delete the useless comments in both your code and your teammates code.

ğŸŸ£ Avoid leaving journal comments that contain historical changes on the codebase and leave this job to the version control systems.

ğŸŸ£ Never talk about code that is somewhere else. If the code is changed, your comment will become a lie.

ğŸŸ£ Do not comment for mandatory purposes such as having a rule that says that every function must have a Javadoc.

ğŸŸ£ Avoid leaving ambiguous or unclear comments called mumble comments, as they can lead to confusion for other developers reviewing the code.

ğŸŸ£ Do not leave commented-out code in the source code. It confuses future developers and version control systems.

ğŸŸ£ Never talk about code that is somewhere else. If the code is changed, your comment will become a lie.

ğŸ’œ No one usually wants to maintain comments.

ğŸ’œ A good idea to have a comment that tells you what the regular expression is matching.

## Naming
ğŸŸ£ Reveal your intent about variable, functions etc by naming descriptive.

ğŸŸ£ Update the name when it that requires a comment does not reveal its intent.

ğŸŸ£ Evaluate variable scope according to how many times it appears in naming. Long scope needs to more detailed name to remind you of usage well.

ğŸŸ£ Variable names that are in a couple of lines of if statement, tiny while loop, or four lines long functions should be pretty short.

ğŸŸ£ Global names have a huge scope and instance variables have a slightly huge scope in class. Their name should be long and descriptive.

ğŸŸ£ Function and class names have an opposite naming approach than variable names. When a function or class scope is large, its name should shrink.

ğŸŸ£ Avoid using noise words when naming like data, info etc. These names do not explain anything for us.

ğŸŸ£ Do not name some functions with nearly same meaning as GetAccounts(), GetAccounts(), or GetAccountData()

## Security
ğŸŸ£ Do not include confidential information like security credentials in the code. Take these credentials from trusted providers.

## Testing
ğŸŸ£ Ensure the code works instead of guessing it works before you release it.

ğŸŸ£ Be ready to deploy before iteration ends. It may not have enough features to deploy. However, this is a business decision.

ğŸŸ£ Do not deploy your project by hoping there will be no error and if you did not test the code well, no error in prod within a time range does not show us it is okay.

ğŸŸ£ Do not slow down as system gets older. You should be able to produce features with same rate at the whenever period of the project.

ğŸŸ£ Leverage unit tests to be sure about your code.

ğŸŸ£ Do not except the QA team find bugs in your code. They should find nothing.

ğŸŸ£ Decouple the application from its tests. Changes made to the application should not impact the tests, ensuring that modifications can be made to either side independently.

ğŸŸ£ Build APIs for tests you use for decoupling.

ğŸŸ£ Do not forget the tests are part of the entire system.

ğŸŸ£ Avoid from manual tests, automate them because the number of manual tests that are used will be decreased with time.

ğŸ’œ It is common for the structure of the application code and the test code to differ, reflecting their distinct purposes and responsibilities.

ğŸ’œ QA team is under the most stress between IT teams. They pass some tests due to stakeholder pressure. Therefore, we should not believe they guarantee code quality.

## Estimation
ğŸŸ£ Give three honest deadline estimations from worst scenario to best scenario to your managers.

ğŸŸ£ Say no if the answer is actually no without hesitating when your colleagues want you to commit something.

ğŸŸ£ Refuse feature estimates that make the team slow in long-term because missing feature estimates cost you to slowness.

## File Structures
ğŸŸ£ Try to stay under ~120 lines of code for each file.

ğŸŸ£ Prefer 25-45 chars per line and try not to pass 80 chars if there is no necessity.

ğŸ’œ You can limit the number of characters in a single line to 150 characters via IDE you use.

## Architecture
ğŸŸ£ Make the maintenance effort constant for keeping systems well according to time.

ğŸŸ£ Minimize the human resources required to build and maintain software systems.

ğŸŸ£ Enable the architecture to accommodate changes in direct proportion to its level of scope.

ğŸŸ£ Assert your authority about showing the importance of architecture when prioritising tasks due to stakeholders just care about requirements.

ğŸŸ£ Do not forget stakeholders have no right to tell us what the architecture ought to be and say us to skip the architecture for getting a task done fast.

ğŸŸ£ Defend what you believe without giving up against people that have a method to seek truth by testing people and trying to understand actually people know.

ğŸŸ£ Be responsible for the importance, not the urgency that comes from stakeholders. *[Check out this page!](https://e-student.org/eisenhower-matrix/)
 
ğŸ’œ If architecture comes last, cost will grow.

## General
ğŸŸ£ Do not expect you to say that destroys our entire architecture when a small change comes up from customer.

ğŸŸ£ Make software easily changeable to meet requirements in both today and tomorrow. This is not hardware and it comes from soft.

ğŸŸ£ Make getting better your code with time, not worse.

ğŸ’œ Software means that easily changeable products opposite to the hardware.

## Teamwork
ğŸŸ£ Cover your teammates especially when they fail.

ğŸŸ£ Prefer the pair programming with your teammates for active learning instead of making the code reviews.

ğŸŸ£ Make the pair programming at few times a week as 30min or 1hr, no need to be planned.

ğŸŸ£ Set branch and pull request rules to keep on track and stay updated for everyone's work.

ğŸŸ£ Show fearless competence for cleaning bad code somebody else wrote it and do not afraid from if I break it, it will be yours.
